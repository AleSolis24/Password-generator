## How to Use 
​
The website is very easy to use. 
​
- A prompt would appear when you hit generate button.
- prompt would ask how long would you like your password to be
- A serious of question would be provided to the user to see what kind of characther the user want to use for their password.
- Once the user implement what kind of characther they would like to use the password would generate a random password for the user to use.

## Challenges 
The main challenge I had with this project was really generating the password. After going to multiple sites and looking at other classmates example I was able to really understand on how function and if and else 
statement really work. The best way I was able to overcome this challenge was really using a lot of console.log() and debugging a lot of my functions.
